    <h1>Researcher and Data Analyst</h1>

    <p>
      During this project I proposed the design of system architecture
      of a peer-to-peer energy trading system and lead its
      technological development.
    </p>

    <p>
      This work involved several tasks. I have programmed the
      optimisation engine using the library for the linear programming
      in <code>Python</code>.  Tested the function of the measurement
      devices and ensuring the reliability of data collection. I have
      also programmed the backend system (<code>PHP, Laravel</code>
      framework) and leading the development of the frontend
      (<code>ReactJS</code>). The system was design process focused on
      the ease of the code maintenance continuous integration and
      deployment using the modern software tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      During this time I have also gained more knowledge of the
      electricity market in Czechia and had participated on a range of
      tasks involving the analysis and prediction of the likely
      behaviour of the electricity system.

    <h1>Postdoctoral Research Associate</h1>

    <p>
      I was associated to a project Analysis and Design for Accelerated
      Production of Tailored Composites (ADAPT) with a line manager
      <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/engineering/staff/td336">Timothy
	Dodwell</a>. This project aims to develop novel
      manufacturing methods for composite materials for
      aerospace engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the process of manufacture the carbon fiber and resin are
      heated up in a pressure chamber. This allows for the
      consolidation of the carbon fibers, while the excess of the
      resin is expelled from the composite. The challenges of the
      computation is the non-linear behaviour of the carbon fibre.
    </p>

    <p>
      During this project I was working on development of simulation
      code implementing three dimensional structural model of carbon
      fiber manufacture. This involved simulations of partial
      differential equations (PDE), finite element methods (FEM) and
      continuum mechanics.
