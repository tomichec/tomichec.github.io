    <h1>PhD Degree</h1>

    <p>
      I have finished a PhD in applied mathematics at the
      College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical
      Sciences (<a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/">CEMPS</a>)
      at the <a href="http://www.exeter.ac.uk/">University of
	Exeter</a> supervised
      by <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/mathematics/staff/vb262">Prof
	Vadim N. Biktashev</a>. My <it>viva voce</it> exam was
      in front of examining pannel of 
      <a href="http://www-binf.bio.uu.nl/panfilov/">
	Prof Alexander Panfilov</a> from Gent University,
      Belgium
      and <a href="http://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/pashwin/">Prof
	Peter Ashwin</a> from University of Exeter.
    </p>

    <p>
      The area of application of my thesis are mathematical models of
      the heart, i.e. cardiac models. Those models can help to
      understand the function of heart, as well as explain
      pathologies and suggest possible treatment of patients.
    </p>

    <p>
      The heart can be studied in different
      levels. From the macroscopic scale of whole organism,
      into larger details of the organ, tissue and finally
      microscopical level of individual cells.
    </p>

    <p>
      My research focuses on the cellular models describing
      electrical activity. The electrical excitation triggers
      a chain of processes at theirs end is the contraction of
      the cardiac muscle. So, that we can say that the
      electricity drives the regular beating of the heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      The electric activity relies on membrane ionic channels
      which are mathematically described by a system of
      ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Those equations
      are ultimately solved by computer algorithms, that can
      predict how will the system evolve in time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ionic channel can be described by a state model called
      Markov chain. The states represent specific molecular
      conformation of the channel. The properties of many of
      Markov chain models require very intensive and time
      demanding computation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Together with my PhD
      adviser, <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/mathematics/staff/vb262">Prof
	Vadim N. Biktashev</a>, we aim to develop efficient
      numerical methods for solving Markov chain ion channel
      models.

    <h1>Master Degree</h1>
    <p>
      I have finished a master in
      <a href="http://www.mibvalencia.es/web.php?lang=en&id=16&title=Master%27s-description">
	Biomedical Engineering</a> in Valencia, Spain. I have
      took a specialisation in Bioelectricity which allowed me
      learn more about electrical properties of cells and
      also about engineering methods of signal processing or
      design of electronic devices used for the acquisition of
      biological signals.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the end of my master I was offered an Erasmus travel
      grant to take part in an internship
      at the Department of Electrical, Electronic and Information
      Engineering
      (<a href="http://www.dei.unibo.it/en">DEI</a>) of the
      University of Bologna, Italy.    During my stay I have develop my final project
      advised by of
      <a href="https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/stefano.severi">
	Prof Stefano Severi</a>,
      <a href="http://www.physics.manchester.ac.uk/people/staff/profile/?ea=Sanjay.Kharche">
	Dr Sanjay Kharche</a>
      and

	Prof Jose Maria Ferrero</a>.
    <p>

    <p>
      The aim of the project was to asses the effect of the
      omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (EPA and DHA) 
      present in fish oil on a function of a particular
      potassium channel (human slowly activated potassium
      channel <i>I<sub>Ks</sub></i>).
    </p>

    <p>
      Using experimental data from electrical measurements on
      cells we have estimated the optimal parameter set of the
      <i>I<sub>Ks</sub></i> Markov chain model in control conditions and after
      an exposure to fatty acids. Consequently we estimated
      those effects within a cellular simulations.
    </p>

    <h1>Bachelor Degree</h1>

    <p>
      I have finished a bachelor degree in Electrical
      Engineering with major in Biomedical Engineering at the
      <a href="http://www.vsb.cz/en">VSB-TU Ostrava</a>. This interdisciplinary degree was
      designed with the emphasis on the application of
      electrical engineering and computer science in medical
      environment. Besides tutorials in both classical
      engineering and medicine subjects , we have also
      participated in field training in the University
      Hospital of Ostrava.
    </p>

    <p>
      My final project was focused on the development of
      documentation for the implementation of system for blood
      glucose metering in the University Hospital.
