The following code represents my key fingerprint. You should see the
same fingerprint after you import my key to your key management tool
of your PGP application, e.g. for commandline use the command:

$ gpg --fingerprint tomas@stary.co.uk

pub   rsa4096 2020-05-08 [SC]
      1AF8 45D6 42DA C5FE EC17  1E04 95F8 AF22 DECC 0955
uid           [ unknown] tomas@stary.co.uk <tomas@stary.co.uk>
sub   rsa4096 2020-05-08 [E]

To verify it even more reliably feel free to ask me for the
fingerprint through another communication channel as well.
