    <h1>Overview</h1>
    
    <p>
      I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the
      University of Exeter, UK working under program Analysis
      and Design for Accelerated Production of Tailored
      Composites (ADAPT) for airospace engineering. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I have finished
      a <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/mathematics/staff/ts363">PhD
	degree</a> in mathematical biology at the University of
      Exeter, UK focused on mathematical models of electric
      current in the heart (cardiac electrophysiology).  I
      have recieved my master in biomedical engineering from
      the Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain and a
      degree in electrical engineering from VSB-TU Ostrava,
      Czech republic.
